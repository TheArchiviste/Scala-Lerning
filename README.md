# Scala Learning Journey

Welcome to my Scala learning journey! This repository serves as a documentation of my progress, key takeaways, and projects in Scala.

## 🚀 Why Scala?
Scala is a powerful, high-level programming language that seamlessly blends object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It is widely used in big data processing, distributed systems, and backend development, particularly with frameworks like Akka and Play.

## 📌 Learning Goals
- Understand the fundamental syntax and semantics of Scala.
- Master both functional and object-oriented programming concepts.
- Learn data manipulation and concurrent programming in Scala.
- Implement algorithms and data structures in Scala.

## 📂 Progress & Topics Covered
- [x] Introduction to Scala (Syntax, Variables, Data Types)
- [x] Control Structures (Loops, Conditionals)
- [x] Functions and Higher-Order Functions
- [x] Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Traits, Inheritance)
- [x] Functional Programming Concepts

## 🛠️ Projects & Exercises
As I progress, I will be working on the following:
- ✅ Simple File Handling System
- ✅ Data Structures and Algorithms

Happy coding! 😊
